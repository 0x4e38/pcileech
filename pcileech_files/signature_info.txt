Signature Guide for OS unlock signatures and Kernel Module Inserts
==================================================================



GENERAL
=======
Signature files are read line by line.     Signature files may contain multiple
signature lines.  The exception is kernel module inserts by page table hijack -
which may only contain one line.    Each line contains either a comment, starts
with '#', or a signature line.  Signature lines are comma separated and divided
into 'chunks'. Each chunk contains an 'offset' and a 'data' section. The offset
is a hexadecimal dword. The data section is binary data which can be either of:
- = no data.
DEFAULT_ = data loaded from builtin pre-defined shellcodes.
ASCIIHEX = data as asciihex.
FILENAME = file name to load binary data from.

EXAMPLE:
B60,FF15C207,0,-,1aab00,file.bin
The example contains three chunks. 
chunk[0] = offset B60 and data FF15C207.
chunk[1] = offset 0 and no data.
chunk[2] = offset 1aab00 and data loaded from file.



UNLOCK OS SIGNATURE FORMAT
==========================
An operating system unlock signature file have the extension '.sig'. A file may
contain multiple unlock signatures.  An unlock signature consists exactly three
(3) chunks. Each offset is a page offset ranging between 0-fff. Pleae note that
unlock signatures may be used to patch any code - just not OS login code.
chunk[0] = search pattern 'data' at 'offset' distance from page base.
chunk[1] = search pattern 'data' at 'offset' distance from page base.
           only searched in same page as chunk[0] if match is made in chunk[0].
           optional. if not used specify data: '-'
chunk[2] = replace contents with 'data' at distance 'offset' from page base.



KERNEL MODULE SIGNATURE FORMAT #1 - memory search
=================================================
The default format for kernel signatures is the memory search format.   This is
used by PCILeech to search the memory for a signature, which is then patched.
chunk[0] = search pattern 'data' at 'offset' distance from page base. 
           This page contains the function to be overwritten by stage #1 code.
chunk[1] = search pattern 'data' at 'offset' distance from page base.
           Stage #2 code will be placed in this page.
chunk[2] = offset to where to place stage #1 code, and stage #1 code.
chunk[3] = offset to where to place stage #2 code, and stage #2 code.
chunk[4] = <offset not in use>, and stage #3 code.



KERNEL MODULE SIGNATURE FORMAT #2 - page table hijack
=====================================================
The page table hijack format is used when a page table needs to be hijacked in
order to gain execution (if the targeted executable memory is above 4GB)
chunk[0] = <offset not in use>, 4096-bytes of original page bytes for page in
           which stage #1 code should be placed.           
chunk[1] = <offset not in use>, 4096-bytes of original page bytes for page in
           which stage #2 code should be placed.
chunk[2] = offset to where to place stage #1 code, and stage #1 code.
chunk[3] = offset to where to place stage #2 code, and stage #2 code.
chunk[4] = <offset not in use>, and stage #3 code.
chunk[5] = <offset not in use>, "driver signature"
